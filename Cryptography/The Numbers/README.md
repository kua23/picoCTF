# The Numbers

Points: 50

### Challenge

The numbers... what do they mean?

### Hint

The flag is in the format PICOCTF{}

## Solution
This is an extremely simple substitution cypher. Each number given corresponds to its letter counterpart. On substituting them respectfully, we get the flag.
Alternatively, we can use this [code](https://github.com/kua23/picoCTF/blob/main/Cryptography/The%20Numbers/thenumbers.py) too

### Flag
`PICOCTF{THENUMBERSMASON}`
